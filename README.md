1)  SONAR - Rock Vs Mine Prediction :

 From the dataset we need to predict if the object detected by SONAR is Rock or Mine.

1. Collected the dataset for the project from Kaggle.

2. Cleaned and prepared dataset using MS EXCEL and using pandas libray (in python).

3. Analyzed the dataset and after analyzing, used proper algorithm for the model that is Logistic Regression algorithm.

4. Finally, we get the accuracy of 76% or 0.76 accuracy score.



2) Credit Card Fraud Detection :
 
 From the dataset we need to predict if the transaction done by credit card is legit or fraud

1. Collected the  credit card dataset for the project from Kaggle.

2. Cleaned and prepared dataset using MS EXCEL and use or import libraries like pandas, numpy and more in python.

3. Analyzed the dataset and after analyzing, used proper algorithm for the model that is Logistic Regression algorithm.

4. Finally, we get the accuracy of 97.33% or 0.9733 accuracy score.
